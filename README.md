# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
With the task at hand, determining the number of employees retiring per their title and to identify possible people to become mentors, the results speak for themselves. There are a lot of employees that are on the cusp of retirement. With the mentorship program, we will fill the open roles.

## Results

Here are some results that I got from the analysis:

- With the first table that we made, Retirement_Titles, we were able to establish all the employees that are going to retire along with all the titles they had. This is to help narrow down who we are looking at. It has people that are born between 1952 to 1955. This is because they are the age group that is most likely to retire soon that needs to be replaced quickly. It also helps us pull from this table to further narrow it down.
- The next table that we created was Unique_Titles. This is to stop the duplication of previous titles and leave out any people that may have still been in the Retirement_Titles that has already left. It also helps with the next table to get specific roles.
- The Retiring_Titles is about the number of specified roles that need to be filled. This will help with the hiring process the most because it puts a number on the number of spots left to be filled. Here is a chart of how desperate we are in some of the roles:

As you can tell, we are losing a lot of senior engineers and senior staff. While those roles are important, we are also losing a lot on just engineers. We are going to start needing to hire people in the tens of thousands to just keep them a stable flow of them. It is paramont how important these numbers are. This leads us into the final table.

- The final table is the Mentorship_Eligibility table. This table includes the start of someone getting hired on and how old they are. This helps out with who has been with the company the longest and that knowledge is important to teach in the mentorship. I think that we should start asking the people with the most seniority at the company first and go from there. There is a 17 year difference between some of the canidates. While that shouldn't disqualify them, this gap in experience could make a difference if there is a need to compare new methods to older ones.

## Summary
There is an urgent need to start rehiring right now. I predict that we would need to hire at least 10,000 more senior engineers each year to possibly stay a float. If they start retiring at an even quickier pace then maybe 20,000 more senior engineers. We could promote some other engineers to this role and mentor them to get ready for the position. We will need to hire another 5,000 engineers to fill in the ones that are retiring and some more to fill in the ones that got promoted. I would highly recommend the same action that was done for senior engineers for the senior staff. The staff is also going to be needing 4,000 more people. We could hire a 1,000 for the technique leader roles and maybe a few hundred more assistant engineers. A couple managers can be hired on or promoted into that position.
I think there is enough people to possibly mentor the next generation. We would need to get over 1,000 senior engineers and senior staff to stay on to get mentor 20 to 30 people each for the next few years. We would need a table that has the retirement-ready employees that are willing to and able to mentor and another query for the ratio between mentors and new hires.
